			We're a small team students based at UCSB, who want to help you find
			your classes quickly. With the power of this search engine, look for
			any classroom by entering the building number and the room number,
			and check out it's schedule. That way, you can see if it's free an
			open to study in. Long term this project is looking to expand to find
			new ways to help students plan and schedule. Stay tuned for more
			updates! <a href="/"><br>Back to Search</a>
